      Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other
online sites have increased the online payment modes, the classifier with a better rating
score can be chosen to be one of the best methods to predict frauds. Thus, followed by a
feedback mode, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers
started using different machine learning methods mechanisms to solve the problem of
concept drift.
          To detect and analyze frauds in online transactions. Due to rapid advancements
in electronic commerce technology, the use of credit cards has dramatically increased. Since
a credit card is the most popular mode of payment, the number of fraud cases associated
with it is also rising. Here we implement different machine learning algorithms on an
imbalanced dataset such as logistic regression, na√Øvebayes, random forest with ensemble
classifiers using boosting techniques.
 Here An review is done on the existing and proposed models for credit card
fraud detection and has done a comp arative study on these techniques. So Different
classification models are applied to the data and the model performance is evaluated on the
basis of quantitative measurements such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, support,
confusion matrix.
       The conclusion of our study explains the best classifier by training and testing
using supervised techniques that provides a better solution.
